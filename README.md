An example project and code to run a greenhouse (or maybe a local food revolution ...).

As always it's a Work In Progress (WIP).

As demand grows for high quality produce and the thirst for robust low impact supply chains expands a number of projects are being created to commercialize and educate the consumer. However, everyone should be able to create their own sustainable food source.

Some examples include:

- Paris, France - Agricool
- Bay Area, United States -
- MIT food computer V1, V2, V3 [link](https://wiki.openag.media.mit.edu/)

- Monterey

## The Plan - v0.1 Backyard Greenhouse

### Lessons learnt

1. Insulate where possible the sump tank
2. It's very hard to holesaw PVC, try to use fittings instead
3. Assume you don't have wifi
4. Ensure you have multiple water routes
5. Design your circuits
6. You are at the mercy of water temp

### How to

#### The plan

The overall design evolved as it was built but I am realtivly confident that it is in a stable state now.

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_4307.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_1213.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

#### Step 1 - Build the greenhouse

Select an area and get it levelled off and make sure the bottom is well draining.

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_4750.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>
<img src="/assets/img/IMG_9652.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyyYJgxaFM) shows the process. Note be sure to measure the space. In our case we had to leave out one section due to a leaning fence.

You you will need at least 2 people.

#### Step 2 - Cut the IBCs in half

First be sure that they are clean. If not use a pressure washer to clean them.

1. Take the IBCs out of their metal cages - keep the metals bars as they will be used later.
2. Use a string line and sharpie to mark all 4 sides of the container.
3. Cut them with the angle grinder using a cutting disk.
4. Trim the extra metal such that it is not pertruding.
5. Mount the top half of the metal cages to the 4 pallets.
6. Replace the 1/2 IBCs into the 8 pallet holders/containers.

#### Step 3 - Wash the rocks

Depending on what media you have selected its a great idea to wash them such that minimal debris is present.

You can use two of the IBCs and place them at an angle such that the water drains through the valve.

Use the pressure washer and add the rocks as you clean them.

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0695.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

#### Step 4 - Setup the water flow

Now we want to create the water flow for the setup.

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_4515.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

1. Place the deep water culture IBCs on the side of you preference.
2. Place the cider blocks in groups of four such that you can place the IBCs with original bottoms on them.
3. Determine your water route
4. Use the holesaw to cut the desired holes
5. Install the uniseals
6. Cut the PVC to length and glue the required sections
7. Trim the PVC so that it has a taper with a stanley knife
8. Use dish soap to push the PVC through
9. Move the rock IBCs to their positions
10. Attache the union joints using thread tape to get a good seal
11. Create the top water dispenser manifold
12. Create the bottom water manifold
13. Connect the water manifolds to the tank and pump outlet
14. Create the swirl filter

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_2832.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

15. Create the bioreactor

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_7655.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

16. Install the airpump and stones
17. Install the pump and connect to water inlets
18. Begin water filling and cycling, fill the deep water IBCs first

The system should now be cycling and you can add the fish once you are comfortable with the flow and water quality.

#### Step 5 - Create floating rafts

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0008.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

Paint the tops of the boards.

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0010.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0011.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0012.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0013.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

Measure out the Dow Blue board and cut it with a sharp knife, angle grinder or multi tool.

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0009.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

Create the 2" hole for the planting. Create a offset pattern depending on what you intend to grow.

Keep the hole cut outs as you may want to place them back in to grow in alternate configurations.

#### Step 6 - Water manifolds and sensing

Create the water manifolds with the solenoids.

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0305.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

Attach them to the top water pipes.

Using the particle board, connect it to the relay module and program it to cycle.

Using another particle add the temp, humidity, light and any other sensors you'd like. (TODO)

Run the wiring and solder where neccasary.

### Fish

In order of ease:

1. Gold fish
2. Koi

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0443.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

3. Talapia (Temp and water quality can be challenging)
4. Trout (Temp and water quality can be challenging)

## (Coming Soon) For Real - v0.2 20 and 40ft containers! (Maybe...)

Building out vertical solutions in a container that can be delivered to you or a driveway near you.

## DIY v. OTS

There are a number of items and even complete systems that you can buy. I have taken a very DIY centric approach to ensure that costs are kept low.

This has however, created a number of challenges and made some things take longer as I looked for solutions.

## Future enhancements

1. Proper sealing
2. Cameras
3. Heating and cooling
	1. https://www.overclockers.com/extreme-water-cooling-using-refrigeration/
	2. Evaporative
	3. HVAC $$$?
	4. Cooling wall
4. Add vertical growing ala [zip grow](https://zipgrow.com/)
5. Add aeroponics [link](https://hackaday.io/project/12398/instructions)
6. Add fully automated robotic crop maintaince - [farmbot](https://farm.bot)
7. Live camera streaming and image object detection plus localization/masking. [hack](https://hackernoon.com/hacking-a-25-iot-camera-to-do-more-than-its-worth-41a8d4dc805c)
